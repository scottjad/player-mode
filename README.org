** Would like to support
   - Amazon Instant Video
   - Netflix

** Installation
   : cd ~/.conkerorrc
   : git clone https://github.com/scottjad/player-mode.git
   : ln -s player-mode/player.js .

** How to add additional sites
   Add something like this to your Conkeror RC file:

   #+BEGIN_SRC js2
     def_player_site("grooveshark",
                     build_url_regexp($domain = "grooveshark", $allow_www = true),
                     {"play": "#play-pause",
                      "mute": "#volume",
                      "previous": "#play-prev",
                      "next": "#play-next"});
   #+END_SRC

   If you're adding support for a popular site, please consider adding it
   to player.js and creating a pull request once you've tested it
   extensively.

   You might want to use something like this to find the the selectors.

   #+BEGIN_SRC js2
     require("dom-inspector");
     define_key(default_global_keymap, "C-c i", "inspect-click");
   #+END_SRC

** How to add additional commands
   Say you like to give songs the thumbs down on Pandora. You could add
   support like this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC js2
     interactive("player-thumbs-down",
                 "Click the thumbs down button.",
                 player_command("thumbs-down",
                                "No thumbs down button found"));

     define_key(player_keymap, "C-c C-d", "player-thumbs-down");

   Or for a like button on Spotify:
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC js2
     player_button_selectors["spotify"]["like"] = player_iframe_button("#app-player","#track-add:not(.added)");

     interactive("player-like",
                 "Click the like button.",
                 player_command("like",
                                "No like button found"));

     define_key(player_keymap, "C-c C-u", "player-like");
   #+END_SRC

** Controlling your player from your window manager
   You could bind a key in your window manager to run a command like
   this:
   : conkeror -f player-play

   This will first try to interact with the current buffer, but if
   player-mode is not supported there, then it will interact with the
   last buffer where player-mode commands were used, if that buffer has
   not changed to a new document.

** Interacting with the last used buffer
   To interact with the same buffer that player last used, if it is no
   longer the current buffer, you would use:
   : conkeror -f player-last -f player-play

   To do this from within conkeror on a buffer that is in player-mode,
   you can use =C-c C-l= then a normal player command keybinding like
   =C-c C-n=.

   There's currently no way to control the last used buffer from within
   Conkeror if the current buffer is not in player-mode. I use my window
   manager bindings in that scenario.

** Limitations

  - Does not handle players whose controls are Flash not HTML. If the
    site uses Flash to play the media itself that's fine.

  - Currently no way to turn page-modes on by something other than url.
    So Youtube players on blogs won't work unless player-mode is enabled
    manually. And right now even if it is enabled manually it won't be
    able to find the player because that's done by url. There should be
    a fix for this.

  - Currently no way to have two different players on one page, such as
    a blog where one article has a youtube player and a soundcloud
    player.

  - Should eventually support the browser's built-in HTML5 media player
    itself. Maybe work up from the currently focused element to find a
    media player to use, and failing that use the url.
